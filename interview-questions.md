# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: a function is a block of code that executes any code found inside it's code block. You would use a function to have reusable code that you can call.

  Researched answer:

  set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. It allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want.


2. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: Filter is used to remove items from the array whereas map just iterates over it.

  Researched answer:

  The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element. The filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function

3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: return is returning a value from a function. Console.log is printing what ever is inside the paranthesis into the console.

  Researched answer:

console.log will display the parameter passed to the log method in the console window.

he return statement, the function will stop executing, and return the specified value.

4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer:

  A value you pass into a function.

  Researched answer:

Function arguments are the real values passed to (and received by) the function.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:

  driver writes the code and checks for syntax errors
  the navigator guides them and focuses on the logic.

  Researched answer:

The driver is the one with their hands on the keyboard. They are responsible for entering information and following the instructions given by the navigator. This approach requires constant communication. And talking about your code will make you a better developer and a better teammate. It is important to switch roles every 10-20 minutes and take frequent break

6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: testing your code after every few lines of code. write the tests and then fill it in with your code.

  Researched answer:

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the code is improved so that the tests pass.

7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:

One of the most helpful things is giving examples of challenges of the code after lecture  or before doing the challenges.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
